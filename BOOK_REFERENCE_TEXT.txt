“IF YOU WANT TO GATHER HONEY, DON’T KICK OVER 
THE BEEHIVE.” 
On May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had ever known had come to its climax. 
After weeks of search, “Two Gun” Crowley—the killer, the gunman who didn’t smoke or drink—was at bay, 
trapped in his sweetheart’s apartment on West End Avenue. 
One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideaway. They chopped 
holes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop killer,” with teargas. Then they mounted their 
machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York’s fine residential areas 
reverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an 
over-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like 
it ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York. 
When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun 
desperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. “He will kill,” 
said the Commissioner, “at the drop of a feather.” 
But how did “Two Gun” Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into 
his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may concern, ” and, as he wrote, the blood flowing from 
his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a 
kind one—one that would do nobody any harm.” 
A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girlfriend on a country road 
out on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said, “Let me see your license.” 
Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As 
the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into 
the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that 
would do nobody any harm.’ 
Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he 
say, “This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said, “This is what I get for defending myself.” 
The point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley didn’t blame himself for anything. 
Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this: 
“I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good 
time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.” 
That’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious Public Enemy—the most sinister gang 
leader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public 
benefactor—an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor. 
And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one 
of New York’s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he 
believed it. 
I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York’s 
infamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that “few of the criminals in Sing 
Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They 
can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of 
11 
reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their anti-social acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly 
maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.” 
If Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison 
walls don’t blame themselves for anything—what about the people with whom you and I come in contact? 
John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed, “I learned thirty years ago 
that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact 
that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.” 
Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third 
of a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize 
themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be. 
Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify 
himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and 
arouses resentment. 
B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded 
for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal 
punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not 
make lasting changes and often incur resentment. 
Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, “As much as we thirst for approval, we dread 
condemnation.” 
The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and 
still not correct the situation that has been condemned. 
George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company. One of 
his responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He 
reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of 
authority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after 
he left, the workers would remove the hats. 
He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their 
hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant 
tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the 
job. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset. 
You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a thousand pages of history, Take, for 
example, the famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and President Taft—a quarrel that split the 
Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and wrote bold, luminous lines across the First 
World War and altered the flow of history. Let’s review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped 
out of the White House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went 
off to Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded. He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to 
secure the nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all but demolished the G.O.P. 
In the election that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican party carried only two states—Vermont 
and Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever known. 
Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame himself? Of course not. With tears in his 
eyes, Taft said: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.” 
Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don’t know, and I don’t care. The point I am trying to 
make is that all of Theodore Roosevelt’s criticism didn’t persuade Taft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft 
strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently 
from what I have.” 
Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing with indignation in the early 
1920s. It rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men, nothing like it had ever happened before in 
12 
American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding’s 
cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome—oil reserves 
that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He 
handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave 
Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a “loan” of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed 
manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent 
wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of 
guns and bayonets, rushed into court—and blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that 
it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and 
put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars. 
Fall was condemned viciously—condemned as few men in public life have ever been. Did he repent? 
Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public speech that President Harding’s death had been due to 
mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her 
chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed, “What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband 
never betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one 
who has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified.” 
There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves. We are all like 
that. So when you and I are tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let’s remember Al Capone, “Two Gun” 
Crowley and Albert Fall. Let’s realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s 
realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and 
condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say, “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from 
what I have.” 
On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging 
house directly across the street from Ford’s Theater, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln’s long 
body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa 
Bonheur’s famous painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light. 
As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said, “There lies the most perfect ruler of men that the 
world has ever seen.” 
What was the secret of Lincoln’s success in dealing with people? I studied the life of Abraham Lincoln 
for ten years and devoted all of three years to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I 
believe I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of Lincoln’s personality and home life as it is possible 
for any being to make. I made a special study of Lincoln’s method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in 
criticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote 
letters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the country roads where they were sure to be 
found. One of these letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime. 
Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in Springfield, Illinois, he attacked his opponents 
openly in letters published in the newspapers. But he did this just once too often. 
In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by the name of James Shields. Lincoln 
lambasted him through an anonymous letter published in Springfield Journal. The town roared with laughter. 
Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation. He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse, 
started after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel. Lincoln didn’t want to fight. He was opposed to 
dueling, but he couldn’t get out of it and save his honor. He was given the choice of weapons. Since he had very 
long arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, 
on the appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the Mississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; 
but, at the last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped the duel. 
That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln’s life. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art 
of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And 
from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything. 
Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the head of the Army of the 
Potomac, and each one in turn—McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade—blundered tragically and drove 
Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned these incompetent generals, but 
13 
Lincoln, “with malice toward none, with charity for all,” held his peace. One of his favorite quotations was 
“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” 
And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied, “Don’t 
criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.” 
Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln. Let’s take just one illustration: 
The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, 
Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the 
Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him, and a victorious Union 
Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn’t escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent 
opportunity—the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high 
hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his 
orders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate action. 
And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do. He called a 
council of war in direct violation of Lincoln’s orders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all 
manner of excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the waters receded and Lee escaped over the 
Potomac with his forces. 
Lincoln was furious, “ What does this mean?” Lincoln cried to his son Robert. “Great God! What does 
this mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet 
nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances, almost any general could 
have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him myself.” 
In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter. And remember, at this period 
of his life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming from 
Lincoln in 1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke. 
“My dear General, 
I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape. He was 
within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have 
ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, 
how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few—no more than two-thirds 
of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now 
effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.” 
What do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter? 
Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found among his papers after his death. 
My guess is—and this is only a guess—that after writing that letter, Lincoln looked out of the window 
and said to himself, “Just a minute. Maybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the 
quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as 
much blood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my ears had been pierced with the screams and 
shrieks of the wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn’t be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade’s timid 
temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I 
send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him 
condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force 
him to resign from the army.” 
So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had learned by bitter experience that sharp 
criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility. 
Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted with a perplexing problem, he 
used to lean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the White House and 
ask himself, “What would Lincoln do if he were in my shoes? How would he solve this problem?” 
14 
The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody, let’s pull a five-dollar bill out of our pocket, 
look at Lincoln’s picture on the bill, and ask. “How would Lincoln handle this problem if he had it?” 
Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned the Paper brown. For example, 
he once wrote to a man who had aroused his ire: “The thing for you is a burial permit. You have only to speak 
and I will see that you get it.” On another occasion he wrote to an editor about a proofreader’s attempts to 
“improve my spelling and punctuation.” He ordered, “Set the matter according to my copy hereafter and see that 
the proofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his decayed brain.” 
The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better. They allowed him to blow off steam, 
and the letters didn’t do any real harm, because Mark’s wife secretly lifted them out of the mail. They were 
never sent. 
Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am 
all in favor of it, but why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable 
than trying to improve others—yes, and a lot less dangerous.  “Don’t complain about the snow on your 
neighbor’s roof,” said Confucius, “when your own doorstep is unclean.” 
When I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard Harding 
Davis, an author who once loomed large on the literary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article 
about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a 
letter from someone with this notation at the bottom: “Dictated but not read.” I was quite impressed. I felt that 
the writer must be very big and busy and important. I wasn’t the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make an 
impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note with the words: “Dictated but not read.” 
He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me with this scribbled across the 
bottom: “Your bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.” True, I had blundered, and perhaps I 
deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented it so sharply that when I read of the death of 
Richard Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still persisted in my mind—I am ashamed to admit—
 was the hurt he had given me. 
If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until 
death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism, no matter how certain we are that it is justified. 
When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing 
with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity. 
Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest novelists ever to enrich English 
literature, to give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to 
suicide. 
Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he 
was made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? “I will speak ill of no man,” he said, "and 
speak all the good I know of everybody.” 
Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain, and most fools do. 
But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. 
“A great man shows his greatness,” said Carlyle, “by the way he treats little men.” 
Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was returning to his home in Los 
Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet 
in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly 
damaged although nobody was hurt. 
Hoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, 
the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline. 
15 
Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young 
man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just 
caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well. 
You can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise 
pilot would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticize him. 
Instead, he put his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this 
again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.” 
Often parents are tempted to criticize their children. You would expect me to say “don’t.” But I will 
not, I am merely going to say, “Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism, 
‘Father Forgets’.” It originally appeared as an editorial in the People’s Home Journal. We are reprinting it here 
with the author’s permission, as condensed in the Reader’s Digest. 
“Father Forgets” is one of those little pieces which—dashed of in a moment of sincere feeling—strikes 
an echoing chord in so many readers as to become a perennial reprint favorite. Since its first appearance, “Father 
Forgets” has been reproduced, writes the author, W. Livingston Larned, “in hundreds of magazines and house 
organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign 
languages. I have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school, church, and lecture 
platforms. It has been ‘on the air’ on countless occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have 
used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems mysteriously to ‘click’. This one certainly 
did.” 
FATHER FORGETS 
W. Livingston Larned 
Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond 
curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat 
reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside. 
There are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for 
school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I 
called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor. 
At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows 
on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, 
you turned and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Daddy!” and I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your 
shoulders back!” 
Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your 
knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by 
marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive, and if you had to buy them you would be 
more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father! 
Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt 
look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. 
“What is it you want?” I snapped. 
You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and 
kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which 
even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs. 
Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear 
came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my 
reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was 
measuring you by the yardstick of my own years. 
And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as 
big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me 
16 
goodnight. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt 
there, ashamed! 
It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during 
your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and 
laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a 
ritual: “He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!” 
I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, 
I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s arms, your head on her shoulder. I have 
asked too much, too much. 
Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what 
they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism, and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and 
kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.” 
As Dr. Johnson said, “God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.” 
Why should you and I? 
PRINCIPLE 1 
Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.

“THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE.” 
There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of 
that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it. 
Remember, there is no other way. 
Of course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by sticking a revolver in his ribs. You 
can make your employees give you cooperation—until your back is turned—by threatening to fire them. You 
can make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But these crude methods have sharply 
undesirable repercussions. 
The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want. 
What do you want? 
Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire 
to be great. 
John Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey 
said that the deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be important". Remember that phrase: “the desire to 
be important." It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book. 
What do you want? Not many things, but the few that you do wish, you crave with an insistence that 
will not be denied. Some of the things most people want include: 
1. Health and the preservation of life. 
2. Food. 
3. Sleep. 
4. Money and the things money will buy. 
5. Life in the hereafter. 
6. Sexual gratification. 
7. The well-being of our children. 
8. A feeling of importance. 
Almost all these wants are usually gratified—all except one. But there is one longing—almost as deep, 
almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep—which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls “the desire 
to be great.” It is what Dewey calls the “desire to be important”. 
Lincoln once began a letter saying, “Everybody likes a compliment.” William James said, “The 
deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” He didn’t speak, mind you, of the “wish” or 
the “desire” or the “longing” to be appreciated. He said the “craving” to be appreciated. 
Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare individual who honestly satisfies this 
heart hunger will hold people in the palm of his or her hand and “even the undertaker will be sorry when he 
dies.” 
The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing differences between mankind 
and the animals. To illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in Missouri, my father bred fine Duroc-Jersey hogs 
and pedigreed white-faced cattle. We used to exhibit our hogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and 
livestock shows throughout the Middle West. We won first prizes by the score. My father pinned his blue 
ribbons on a sheet of white muslin, and when friends or visitors came to the house, he would get out the long 
sheet of muslin. He would hold one end and I would hold the other while he exhibited the blue ribbons. 
18 
The hogs didn’t care about the ribbons they had won. But Father did. These prizes gave him a feeling 
of importance. 
If our ancestors hadn’t had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance, civilization would have been 
impossible. Without it, we should have been just about like animals. 
It was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an uneducated, poverty-stricken grocery clerk to 
study some law books he found in the bottom of a barrel of household plunder that he had bought for fifty cents. 
You have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name was Lincoln. 
It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens to write his immortal novels. This 
desire inspired Sir Christopher Wren to design his symphonies in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass 
millions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest family in your town build a house far too 
large for its requirements. 
This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cars, and talk about your brilliant 
children. 
It is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and engaging in criminal activities. 
The average young criminal, according to E. P. Mulrooney, one-time police commissioner of New York, is 
filled with ego, and his first request after arrest is for those lurid newspapers that make him out a hero. The 
disagreeable prospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can gloat over his likeness sharing space with 
pictures of sports figures, movie and TV stars and politicians. 
If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your 
character. That is the most significant thing about you. For example, John D. Rockefeller got his feeling of 
importance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in Peking, China, to care for millions of poor people 
whom he had never seen and never would see. Dillinger, on the other hand, got his feeling of importance by 
being a bandit, a bank robber and killer. When the FBI agents were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse up 
in Minnesota and said, “I’m Dillinger!” He was proud of the fact that he was Public Enemy Number One. “I’m 
not going to hurt you, but I’m Dillinger!” he said. 
Yes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and Rockefeller is how they got their feeling of 
importance. 
History sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling for a feeling of importance. Even 
George Washington wanted to be called “His Mightiness, the President of the United States”; and Columbus 
pleaded for the title “Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of India.” Catherine the Great refused to open letters 
that were not addressed to “Her Imperial Majesty”; and Mrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs. 
Grant like a tigress and shouted, “How dare you be seated in my presence until I invite you!” 
Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd’s expedition to the Antarctic in 1928 with the 
understanding that ranges of icy mountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to have 
nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even Shakespeare, mightiest of the mighty, tried to add 
luster to his name by procuring a coat of arms for his family. 
People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of 
importance. For example, take Mrs. McKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her husband, the 
President of the United States, to neglect important affairs of state while he reclined on the bed beside her for 
hours at a time, his arm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing desire for attention by insisting 
that he remain with her while she was having her teeth fixed, and once created a stormy scene when he had to 
leave her alone with the dentist while he kept an appointment with John Hay, his secretary of state. 
The writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright, vigorous young woman who became an 
invalid in order to get a feeling of importance. “One day,” said Mrs. Rinehart, “this woman had been obliged to 
face something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were stretching ahead and there was little left for her to 
anticipate. 
“She took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother traveled to the third floor and back, carrying 
trays, nursing her. Then one day the old mother, weary with service, lay down and died. For some weeks, the 
19 
invalid languished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and resumed living again.” 
Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of 
insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. There are more 
patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases combined. 
What is the cause of insanity? 
Nobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that certain diseases, such as syphilis, 
break down and destroy the brain cells and result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all mental diseases can 
be attributed to such physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and injuries. But the other half—and this is 
the appalling part of the story—the other half of the people who go insane apparently have nothing organically 
wrong with their brain cells. In post-mortem examinations, when their brain tissues are studied under the 
highest-powered microscopes, these tissues are found to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine. 
Why do these people go insane? 
I put that question to the head physician of one of our most important psychiatric hospitals. This 
doctor, who has received the highest honors and the most coveted awards for his knowledge of this subject, told 
me frankly that he didn’t know why people went insane. Nobody knows for sure But he did say that many 
people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of 
reality. Then he told me this story: 
"I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual 
gratification, children and social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes. Her husband didn’t love her. He refused 
even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his room upstairs. She had no children, no social 
standing. She went insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her husband and resumed her maiden name. 
She now believes she has married into English aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith. 
“And as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child every night. Each time I call on 
her she says, ‘Doctor, I had a baby last night.’” 
Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy isles of 
insanity, all her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing and winds singing through the masts. 
“Tragic? Oh, I don’t know. Her physician said to me, ‘If I could stretch out my hand and restore her 
sanity, I wouldn’t do it. She’s much happier as she is.’” 
If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine 
what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity. 
One of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of over a million dollars a year (when 
there was no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a week was considered well-off) was Charles 
Schwab, who had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the first president of the newly formed United 
States Steel Company in 1921, when he was only thirty-eight years old (Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over 
the then-troubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt it into one of the most profitable companies in 
America). 
Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than three thousand dollars a day, to 
Charles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab was a genius? No. Because he knew more about the manufacture of 
steel than other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab told me himself that he had many men working for him who 
knew more about the manufacture of steel than he did. 
Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people. I asked him 
how he did it. Here is his secret set down in his own words—words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and 
hung in every home and school, every shop and office in the land—words that children ought to memorize 
instead of wasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in 
Brazil—words that will all but transform your life and mine if we will only live them: 
“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I 
20 
possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. 
“There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never 
criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. 
If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.” 
That is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact opposite. If they don’t like a 
thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old couplet says: “Once I did 
bad and that I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard never.” 
“In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world,” 
Schwab declared, “I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better 
work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.” 
That he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the phenomenal success of Andrew 
Carnegie. Carnegie praised his associates publicly as well as privately. 
Carnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone. He wrote an epitaph for himself which 
read: “Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself.” 
Sincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first John D. Rockefeller’s success in handling men. 
For example, when one of his partners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad buy in 
South America, John D. might have criticized; but he knew Bedford had done his best, and the incident was 
closed. So Rockefeller found something to praise; he congratulated Bedford because he had been able to save 
60 percent of the money he had invested. “That’s splendid,” said Rockefeller. “We don’t always do as well as 
that upstairs.” 
I have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but it illustrates a truth, so I’ll repeat it: 
According to this silly story, a farmwoman, at the end of a heavy day’s work, set before her menfolks a 
heaping pile of hay. And when they indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied: “Why, how 
did I know you’d notice? I’ve been cooking for you men for the last twenty years and in all that time I ain’t 
heard no word to let me know you wasn’t just eating hay.” 
When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be 
the main reason wives ran away? It was “lack of appreciation”. And I’d bet that a similar study made of 
runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never 
let them know we appreciate them. 
A member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife. She and a group of other women in 
her church were involved in a self-improvement program. She asked her husband to help her by listing six 
things he believed she could do to help herself become a better wife. He reported to the class, “I was surprised 
by such a request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I would like to change about her—
 my heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she would like to change about me—but I didn’t. I said to 
her, ‘Let me think about it and give you an answer in the morning.’ 
“The next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had them send six red roses to my wife 
with a note saying: ‘I can’t think of six things I would like to change about you. I love you the way you are.’ 
“When I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me at the door: That’s right. My wife! 
She was almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as she had requested. 
“The following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results of her assignment, several women 
with whom she had been studying came up to me and said, ‘That was the most considerate thing I have ever 
heard.’ It was then I realized the power of appreciation.” 
Florenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled Broadway, gained his reputation by 
his subtle ability to “glorify the American girl”. Time after time, he took drab little creatures that no one ever 
looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into glamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing 
the value of appreciation and confidence, he made women feel beautiful by the sheer power of his gallantry and 
21 
consideration. He was practical: he raised the salary of chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high as one 
hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous; on opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams to the 
stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the show with American Beauty roses. 
I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating. It wasn’t 
difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as you 
know, people who would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six 
days without food; but they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without 
giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food. 
When Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the leading role in Reunion in Vienna, he 
said, “There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.” 
We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their 
self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind 
words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of the morning stars. 
Paul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, “The Rest of the Story,” told how showing sincere 
appreciation could change a person’s life. He reported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to 
help her find a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated the fact that nature had given 
Stevie something no one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a remarkable pair of ears to compensate 
for his blind eyes. But this was really the first time Stevie had been shown appreciation for those talented ears. 
Now, years later, he says that this act of appreciation was the beginning of a new life. You see, from that time 
on he developed his gift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage name of Stevie Wonder, one of the 
great pop singers and songwriters of the seventies. *

Some readers are saying right now as they read these lines, “Oh, phooey! Flattery! Bear oil! I’ve tried 
that stuff. It doesn’t work—not with intelligent people.” 
Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to 
fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow 
anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms. 
Even Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli confessed that he 
put it on thick in dealing with the Queen. To use his exact words, he said he “spread it on with a trowel.” But 
Disraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit men who ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was 
a genius in his line. What would work for him wouldn’t necessarily work for you and me. In the long run, 
flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually 
get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else. 
The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other 
insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is 
universally admired; the other universally condemned. 
I recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro Obregon in the Chapultepec palace in Mexico 
City. Below the bust are carved these wise words from General Obregon’s philosophy: “Don’t be afraid of 
enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.” 
No! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it. I’m talking about a new way of life. Let me 
repeat. I am talking about a new way of life. 
King George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of his study at Buckingham Palace. One 
of these maxims said: “Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise.” That’s all flattery is—cheap 
praise. I once read a definition of flattery that may be worth repeating: “Flattery is telling the other person 
precisely what he thinks about himself.” 
“Use what language you will,” said Ralph Waldo Emerson, “you can never say anything but what you 
22 
are." 
If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we should all be experts in human 
relations. 
When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent 
of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of 
the other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted 
almost before it is out of the mouth. 
One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation, Somehow, we neglect to 
praise our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our children 
when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse. 
Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval. 
The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently 
prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it. 
Every minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the discouragement of pouring himself or herself 
out to an audience and not receiving a single ripple of appreciative comment. What applies to professionals 
applies doubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our families and friends. In our interpersonal 
relations we should never forget that all our associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the 
legal tender that all souls enjoy. 
Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how 
they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit. 
Pamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her responsibilities on her job the 
supervision of a janitor who was doing a very poor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the 
hallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive time was being lost in the shop. 
Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person. She noticed that occasionally he did a 
particularly good piece of work. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the other people. Each day the 
job he did all around got better, and pretty soon he started doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an 
excellent job and other people give him appreciation and recognition. Honest appreciation got results where 
criticism and ridicule failed. 
Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for. There is an old saying that I have 
cut out and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but see it every day: 
I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any 
human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again. 
Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way, In that, I learn of him.” 
If that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let’s cease 
thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget 
flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and 
people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you 
have forgotten them. 
PRINCIPLE 2 
Give honest and sincere appreciation.

“HE WHO CAN DO THIS HAS THE WHOLE WORLD WITH 
HIM. HE WHO CANNOT WALKS A LONELY WAY.” 
I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries and 
cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think 
about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream. 
Rather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said, “Wouldn’t you like to have that?” 
Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people? 
That is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone 
asked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leaders—Wilson, Orlando and 
Clemenceau—had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any one thing, it 
would be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish. 
Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you 
want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in 
what we want. 
So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how 
to get it. 
Remember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do something. If, for example, you 
don’t want your children to smoke, don’t preach at them, and don’t talk about what you want; but show them 
that cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the hundred-yard dash. 
This is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are dealing with children or calves or 
chimpanzees. For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they 
made the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the 
calf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he wanted, so he stiffened his legs and 
stubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn’t write essays 
and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought 
of what the calf wanted, so she put her maternal finger in the calf’s mouth and let the calf suck her finger as she 
gently led him into the barn. 
Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted 
something. How about the time you gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the 
rule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a 
beautiful, unselfish, divine act. “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have 
done it unto me.” 
If you hadn’t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money, you would not have made the 
contribution. Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a 
customer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution because you wanted something. 
Harry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human Behavior said, “Action springs out of 
what we fundamentally desire, and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether 
in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who 
can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.” 
Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally 
gave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the 
other person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how to handle people. 
24 
To illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were 
so busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s 
frantic letters. 
Then Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail, without 
even asking for it. Someone called his bet, so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a 
post-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill. 
He neglected, however, to enclose the money. 
Back came replies by return mail thanking “Dear Uncle Andrew” for his kind note and…you can finish 
the sentence yourself. 
Another example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our 
course. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the 
living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s 
normal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind 
to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the 
best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to 
kindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing 
songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen 
table—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. 
Next he was begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’ 
With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand, telling him 
all the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs 
and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to 
go to kindergarten. I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager 
want that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.” 
Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask 
yourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?” 
That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires. 
At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in 
order to hold a series of lectures. 
At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times 
as much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all 
announcements had been made. 
Naturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I 
wanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager. 
“I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,” I said, “but I don’t blame you at all. If I had been in your 
position, I should probably have written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make 
all the profit possible. If you don’t do that, you will be fired and you ought to be fired. Now, let’s take a piece of 
paper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase 
in rent.” 
Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column ‘Advantages’ and the 
other column ‘Disadvantages’. 
I wrote down under the head ‘Advantages’ these words: “Ballroom free”. Then I went on to say, “You 
will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage, 
for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for 
twenty nights during the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you. 
25 
“Now, let’s consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing your income from me, you are 
going to decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be 
forced to hold these lectures at some other place. 
“There’s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract crowds of educated and cultured 
people to your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn’t it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars 
advertising in the newspapers, you couldn’t bring as many people to look at your hotel as I can bring by these 
lectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel, isn’t it?”  
As I talked, I wrote these two ‘disadvantages’ under the proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper 
to the manager, saying, “I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are 
going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.” 
I received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent instead 
of 300 percent. 
Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about 
what the other person wanted and how he could get it. 
Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had stormed into his office and said, “What do 
you mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the 
announcements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous! Absurd! I won’t pay it!” 
What would have happened then? An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter, and 
you know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it 
difficult for him to back down and give in. 
Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. “If there is 
any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see 
things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.” 
That is so good, I want to repeat it: "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the 
other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.” 
That is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it at a glance; yet 90 percent of the 
people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time. 
An example? Look at the letters that come across your desk tomorrow morning, and you will find that 
most of them violate this important canon of common sense. Take this one, a letter written by the head of the 
radio department of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the 
managers of local radio stations throughout the country (I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each 
paragraph). 
Mr. John Blank, 
Blankville, 
Indiana 
Dear Mr. Blank, 
The ------ company desires to retain its position in advertising agency leadership in the radio field. 
[Who cares what your company desires? I am worried about my own problems. The bank is foreclosing the 
mortgage on my house, the bugs are destroying the hollyhocks, the stock market tumbled yesterday. I missed the 
eight-fifteen this morning, I wasn’t invited to the Jones’s dance last night, the doctor tells me I have high blood 
pressure and neuritis and dandruff. And then what happens? I come down to the office this morning worried, 
open my mail and here is some little whippersnapper off in New York yapping about what his company wants. 
Bah! If he only realized what sort of impression his letter makes, he would get out of the advertising business 
and start manufacturing sheep dip.] 
26 
This agency’s national advertising accounts were the bulwark of the network. Our subsequent 
clearances of station time have kept us at the top of agencies year after year. 
[You are big and rich and right at the top, are you? So what? I don’t give two whoops in Hades if you are as big 
as General Motors and General Electric and the General Staff of the U.S. Army all combined. If you had as 
much sense as a half-witted hummingbird, you would realize that I am interested in how big I am, not how big 
you are. All this talk about your enormous success makes me feel small and unimportant.] 
We desire to service our accounts with the last word on radio station information. 
[You desire! You desire. You unmitigated ass. I’m not interested in what you desire or what the President of the 
United States desires. Let me tell you once and for all that I am interested in what I desire, and you haven’t said 
a word about that yet in this absurd letter of yours.] 
Will you, therefore, put the ---------- company on your preferred list for weekly station information 
every single detail that will be useful to an agency in intelligently booking time. 
[Preferred list! You have your nerve! You make me feel insignificant by your big talk about your company and 
then you ask me to put you on a ‘preferred’ list, and you don’t even say ‘please’ when you ask it.] 
A prompt acknowledgment of this letter, giving us your latest ‘doings’, will be mutually helpful. 
[You fool! You mail me a cheap form letter—a letter scattered far and wide like the autumn leaves—and you 
have the gall to ask me, when I am worried about the mortgage and the hollyhocks and my blood pressure, to sit 
down and dictate a personal note acknowledging your form letter, and you ask me to do it ‘promptly’. What do 
you mean, ‘promptly’? Don’t you know I am just as busy as you are—or, at least, I like to think I am. And while 
we are on the subject, who gave you the lordly right to order me around? You say it will be ‘mutually helpful’. 
At last, at last, you have begun to see my viewpoint. But you are vague about how it will be to my advantage.] 
Very truly yours, 
John Doe 
Manager Radio Department 
P.S. The enclosed reprint from the Blankville Journal will be of interest to you, and you may want to broadcast 
it over your station. 
[Finally, down here in the postscript, you mention something that may help me solve one of my problems. Why 
didn’t you begin your letter with, but what’s the use? Any advertising man who is guilty of perpetrating such 
drivel as you have sent me has something wrong with his medulla oblongata. You don’t need a letter giving our 
latest doings. What you need is a quart of iodine in your thyroid gland.] 
Now, if people who devote their lives to advertising and who pose as experts in the art of influencing 
people to buy, if they write a letter like that, what can we expect from the butcher and baker or the auto 
mechanic? 
Here is another letter, written by the superintendent of a large freight terminal to a student of this 
course, Edward Vermylen. What effect did this letter have on the man to whom it was addressed? Read it and 
then I’ll tell you. 
A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc. 
28 Front St. 
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 
Attention: Mr. Edward Vermylen 
Gentlemen, 
The operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are handicapped because a material percentage of 
the total business is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition results in congestion, overtime on the part 
of our forces, delays to trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On November 10, we received from your 
company a lot of 510 pieces, which reached here at 4:20 P.M. 
27 
We solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable effects arising from late receipt of 
freight. May we ask that, on days on which you ship the volume which was received on the above date, effort be 
made either to get the truck here earlier or to deliver us part of the freight during the morning? 
The advantage that would accrue to you under such an arrangement would be that of more expeditious 
discharge of your trucks and the assurance that your business would go forward on the date of its receipt. 
Very truly yours, 
J----- B ----- Supt. 
After reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the 
following comment: 
This letter had the reverse effect from that which was intended. The letter begins by describing the 
Terminal’s difficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking. Our cooperation is then requested 
without any thought as to whether it would inconvenience us, and then, finally, in the last paragraph, the fact is 
mentioned that if we do cooperate it will mean more expeditious discharge of our trucks with the assurance that 
our freight will go forward on the date of its receipt. 
In other words, that in which we are most interested is mentioned last and the whole effect is one of 
raising a spirit of antagonism rather than of cooperation. 
Let’s see if we can’t rewrite and improve this letter. Let’s not waste any time talking about our 
problems. As Henry Ford admonishes, let’s “get the other person’s point of view and see things from his or her 
angle, as well as from our own.” 
Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best way, but isn’t it an improvement? 
Mr. Edward Vermylen 
A. Zerega’s Sons, Inc. 
28 Front St. 
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 
Dear Mr. Vermylen, 
Your company has been one of our good customers for fourteen years. Naturally, we are very grateful 
for your patronage and are eager to give you the speedy, efficient service you deserve. However, we regret to 
say that it isn’t possible for us to do that when your trucks bring us a large shipment late in the afternoon, as 
they did on November 10. Why? Because many other customers make late afternoon deliveries also. Naturally, 
that causes congestion. That means your trucks are held up unavoidably at the pier and sometimes even your 
freight is delayed. 
That’s bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your deliveries at the pier in the morning when possible, 
your trucks will be able to keep moving, your freight will get immediate attention, and our workers will get 
home early at night to enjoy a dinner of the delicious macaroni and noodles that you manufacture. 
Regardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always cheerfully do all in our power to serve you 
promptly. You are busy. Please don’t trouble to answer this note. 
Yours truly, 
J----- B-----, supt. 
Barbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New York, desired to move to Phoenix, Arizona, because 
of the health of her son. Using the principles she had learned in our course, she wrote the following letter to 
twelve banks in Phoenix: 
Dear Sir, 
My ten years of bank experience should be of interest to a rapidly growing bank like yours. 
28 
In various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers Trust Company in New York, leading to my 
present assignment as Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all phases of banking including depositor 
relations, credits, loans and administration. 
I will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can contribute to your growth and profit. I will 
be in Phoenix the week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help your bank 
meet its goals. 
Sincerely, 
Barbara L. Anderson 
Do you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited 
her to be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank’s offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state 
what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and focused on their wants, not her own. 
Thousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why? 
Because they are always thinking only of what they want. They don’t realize that neither you nor I want to buy 
anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems. 
And if salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t 
need to sell us. We’ll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying, not being sold. 
Yet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing things from the customer’s angle. For 
example, for many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes in the center of Greater 
New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I chanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought and 
sold property in that area for many years. He knew Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or not my 
stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn’t know and told me what I already knew, 
that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills Garden Association. The following morning, I received a letter 
from him. Did he give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a telephone 
call. But he didn’t. He told me again that I could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle my 
insurance. 
He was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in helping himself. 
J. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople from the same company handled 
the same type of situation, He reported: 
“Several years ago I was on the management team of a small company. Headquartered near us was the 
district office of a large insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our company was 
assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John. 
“One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just 
introduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later on and he would 
get back to us when he had more information on it. 
“The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted, ‘Hey 
Luke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.’ He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an 
executive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day (it was the same policy that Carl had 
casually mentioned). He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the 
coverage and ended saying, ‘The policy is so new, I’m going to have someone from the home office come out 
tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let’s get the applications signed and on the way so he can have 
more information to work with.’ His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still 
did not have details. When they were made available to us, they confirmed John’s initial understanding of the 
policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our coverage. 
“Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the policies.” 
The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly 
tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and 
one of America’s great business leaders, once said, “People who can put themselves in the place of other people 
who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”

If out of reading this book you get just one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of 
other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may 
easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career. 
Looking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to 
be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his 
detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the 
receiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson 
won by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the 
example of John’s sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction. 
Another example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes 
from Michael E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company. 
Mike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him 
back. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape 
that sales were declining significantly. 
This manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas to upgrade the station. After many exhortations 
and heart-to-heart talks—all of which had no impact—Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest 
Shell station in his territory. 
The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the next 
time, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the Number One 
spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn’t helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager, 
by showing him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited. 
Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without 
ever discovering how their own minds function. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the 
young college graduates who were entering the employ of the Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner 
manufacturer. One of the participants wanted to persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this 
is about what he said, “I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few 
times I’ve been to the gymnasium there haven’t been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to 
throwing the ball around the other night—and I got a black eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow 
night. I want to play basketball.” 
Did he talk about anything you want? You don’t want to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to, 
do you? You don’t care about what he wants. You don’t want to get a black eye. 
Could he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep. 
Keener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball. 
To repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who 
can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way. 
One of the students in the author’s training course was worried about his little boy. The child was 
underweight and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and nagged. “Mother 
wants you to eat this and that.” “Father wants you to grow up to be a big man.”  
Did the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a 
sandy beach. 
No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a 
father thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that. 
So he said to himself, “What does that boy want? How can I tie up what I want to what he wants?” 
It was easy for the father when he starting thinking about it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride 
up and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully—a 
bigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it himself. 
30 
Naturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she would have to come out and take 
the bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again. This happened almost every day. 
What did the little boy want? It didn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger, 
his desire for a feeling of importance—all the strongest emotions in his makeup—goaded him to get revenge, to 
smash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights 
out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat—when his father 
promised him that—there was no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach, 
sauerkraut, salt mackerel—anything in order to be big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so 
often. 
After solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy had the unholy habit of wetting 
his bed. 
He slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and 
say, “Look, Johnny, what you did again last night.” 
He would say, “No, I didn’t do it. You did it.” 
Scolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t want him to do it—none of these 
things kept the bed dry. So the parents asked, “How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?” 
What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like 
Grandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a 
pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object. 
His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said, “Here is a 
little gentleman who would like to do some shopping.” 
The salesgirl made him feel important by saying, “Young man, what can I show you?” 
He stood a couple of inches taller and said, “I want to buy a bed for myself.” 
When he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was 
persuaded to buy it. 
The bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the 
door shouting, “Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!” 
The father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab’s injunction: he was “hearty in his approbation 
and lavish in his praise.” 
“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. “Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this 
bed.” The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it. 
And he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did. 
Another father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn’t get his three
year-old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. 
So the parents asked themselves, “How can we make her want to do it?” 
The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a 
chair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen 
while she was stirring the cereal and she said, “Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.” 
She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She had 
achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression. 
William Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why 
can’t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making 
31 
others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; 
they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it. 
 
Remember: “First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world 
with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."
