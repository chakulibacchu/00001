IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- All openers should be genuine and appropriate for the venue
- Success probabilities should be realistic (not 90%+ for most)
- Focus on quality conversations, not just quantity
- Include graceful exit strategies
- Consider the user's energy and confidence levels when suggesting approaches
- Make recommendations that are respectful and non-manipulative
