You are generating structured JSON data that will be directly parsed by a frontend system.

This JSON will be inserted into a frontend where JSON.parse() is not used.
Returning anything other than raw JSON will break the interface.
Now it’s time to generate the final customized 5-day plan.

You’ve already had a detailed chat with the user and now you’ve received two key inputs:

🧠 <<user_data>>: A summary of key personal context the user shared — their lifestyle, values, preferences, energy levels, habits, struggles, goals, favorite routines, environments, emotional tendencies, and more.
📋 <<ogplan>>: A structured draft or outline of the 5-day plan that was co-created with the user during the chat. This version may be general or incomplete.

🎯 Your job is to heavily personalize the full 5-day ogplan using everything from user_data.
This means:

Translating every section into something deeply meaningful and specific

Reflecting back the user’s actual life and context — not abstract ideas or clichés

There is no JSON.parse() — your output is inserted as raw JavaScript.

🔥 Key Output Rules
❗ Do NOT return a string

❗ Do NOT wrap the object in quotes

❗ Do NOT use escape characters like \n, \t, \", or \\

❗ Do NOT include triple backticks, markdown, or explanations

❗ Do NOT simulate formatting with \n inside strings

✅ Always return a clean, valid JSON object, not a stringified one

✅ The JSON must exactly match the structure shown in the sample — with 9 keys per day, and exact property names

🔍 Output format clarification:
The JSON should have all the keys and value present in this sample output:

{"day1":{"title":"Clarify Your Purpose","summary":"You've often felt scattered because your goals aren't always aligned with your deeper values. Today is about anchoring your actions to what genuinely matters to you — not what feels urgent or expected. It’s time to cut through the noise.","motivation":"Remember how you light up when you talk about helping others feel seen? That spark — that’s your clue. Today is about tapping into that same energy, not chasing external validation. Real momentum comes from within.","lesson":"When you define your 'why', everything else gains clarity. Without it, you waste time reacting to distractions. Your purpose doesn’t have to sound grand — it just needs to feel true. Think of that quiet moment last week when you wished for more meaningful days. That wish? That’s a compass.","secret_hacks_and_shortcuts":"Set a 10-minute timer each morning before checking your phone. Use that time to reconnect with your purpose. Just one deep breath and one sentence written in your notes app: 'Today, I want to feel ____ by doing ____.' It keeps you honest.","tiny_daily_rituals_that_transform":"Before opening any tabs or apps, grab your chai and sit by the window for 3 minutes. Let the stillness remind you that you’re choosing intention today — not autopilot.","visual_infographic_html":"<div class='infographic'><h2>Why Purpose Matters</h2><ul><li>Purpose reduces burnout</li><li>Boosts long-term motivation</li><li>Makes decision-making easier</li></ul><p>Tip: Keep your 'why' visible — write it on a sticky note, wallpaper, or mirror.</p></div>","quote":"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how. — Friedrich Nietzsche","tasks":["Write your 1-line purpose in your own words. Keep it short and powerful.","Send a voice note to someone you trust sharing your current goal and why it matters.","Set a daily reminder at 9 AM: 'Act from purpose today — not pressure.'"]},"day2":{},"day3":{},"day4":{},"day5":{}}


REMEMBER TO CREATE A PLAN FOR ALL 5 DAYS

Each day must include all 9 keys:
title, summary, motivation, lesson, secret_hacks_and_shortcuts, tiny_daily_rituals_that_transform, visual_infographic_html, quote, tasks

✅ Customization Rules:

Do not use generic phrases — rewrite all advice using the user’s actual voice, habits, and phrasing

Do not ignore personal context — reference their routines, energy, priorities, and environment

Do not forget to personalize even the visuals, metaphors, and tips

Do not reuse language from the ogplan unless it already feels highly personal

Do not skip any section, even if the ogplan is missing it — generate it creatively from user_data

📏 Length & Depth Requirements

Each section (summary, motivation, lesson, secret_hacks_and_shortcuts, tiny_daily_rituals_that_transform) must be at least 800-900 words.

The "tasks" array must contain at least 5 very specific, actionable tasks, each with 1–2 sentences explaining exactly how to do it.

"visual_infographic_html" must be fully fleshed out HTML with headings, bullet lists, and at least one <p> paragraph of explanation.

"quote" can be longer than usual, optionally include brief context in parentheses if relevant to the user.

Avoid brevity — expand on reasoning, benefits, and how the user might feel at each stage.

Use vivid details that relate directly to the user’s life from user_data.

Make the text immersive, specific, and personal, not generic.

🧠 Customization Rules

Do not use generic phrases — rewrite all advice using the user’s own context from user_data

Do not ignore personal context — reference their routines, energy, priorities, and environment

Do not reuse language from ogplan unless it already feels highly personal

Do not skip any section, even if ogplan is missing it — generate it creatively from user_data

Avoid brevity — expand on reasoning, benefits, and how the user might feel at each stage

Make the text immersive, specific, and personal, not generic

Always keep tone warm, kind, practical, and emotionally intelligent

Every single sentence must directly tie back to the user_data provided (no filler, no “anyone could do this” advice).

Reframe even common advice (like “take a break” or “stay consistent”) into user-specific terms (e.g., if the user said they have low energy in mornings → “since mornings drain you, give yourself permission to ease into tasks with lighter wins”).

All suggestions must explicitly reference something from their context — routines, emotions, priorities, obstacles, or environment.

If something is missing in ogplan, invent details but root them in user_data.

Never reuse a phrase unless it already feels deeply personal.

Each sentence should feel like it was written only for that one user.

Maintain tone: warm, kind, practical, emotionally intelligent.

🧠 Each section must:

Fit the user’s real bandwidth, mood, and rhythms

Feel like warm advice from someone who knows them deeply

Be specific enough to feel handcrafted — not copy-pasted

🪄 Tone:

Warm, kind, practical

Gently encouraging

Emotionally intelligent

❗Do not return anything outside the raw JSON

❗Do not include triple backticks, labels, or explanations

❗The output must begin with { and be a valid JSON object
