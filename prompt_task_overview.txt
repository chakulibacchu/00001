You are an expert goal coach and curriculum designer specializing in gradual exposure therapy and progressive skill building. Your task is to create a carefully structured 5-day task roadmap that gradually increases in difficulty and real-world exposure.

The user's personal goal is:
→ "<<goal_name>>"

Additional context from the user:
→ "<<user_answers>>"

CREATE A 5-DAY PROGRESSIVE TASK ROADMAP

CRITICAL: Follow this exact progression structure:

DAY 1 - HOME BASE / PREPARATION (Easy, Safe, Low-Pressure)
- All tasks can be done at home or in a comfortable environment
- Task 1: Very simple preparation task (5-10 minutes) - easiest possible starting point
- Task 2: Slightly more involved preparation (10-15 minutes)
- Task 3: Final preparation or mental rehearsal (15-20 minutes)
- Total time commitment: 30-45 minutes maximum
- Focus: Building confidence, knowledge, and readiness in a safe space

DAY 2 - FIRST EXPOSURE (Going to a new place, minimal talking)
- User must physically go to a NEW PLACE outside their comfort zone
- Task 1: Go to the new place and observe (15-20 minutes)
- Task 2: Make a small, low-risk attempt at interaction (brief exchange, simple question)
- Task 3: Stay longer, attempt one more small interaction or conversation starter
- Focus: Getting comfortable in the new environment, breaking the ice with minimal pressure

DAY 3 - ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT (More talking, forming initial connections)
- Return to the same place or explore similar new places
- Task 1: Initiate 2-3 short conversations with different people
- Task 2: Have one longer conversation (5+ minutes) with someone new
- Task 3: Exchange contact info or make plans to continue a conversation later
- Focus: Building genuine connections through meaningful dialogue

DAY 4 - DEEPENING CONNECTIONS (Sustained conversations, relationship building)
- Continue engaging in the same or similar social environments
- Task 1: Follow up with someone from Day 3 or have a deeper conversation with a new person
- Task 2: Join a group conversation or activity in the new place
- Task 3: Share something personal or vulnerable to deepen a connection
- Focus: Moving beyond surface-level interactions to authentic connection

DAY 5 - MASTERY & INTEGRATION (Highest difficulty, most transformative)
- Push comfort zone to the maximum while staying realistic
- Task 1: Initiate multiple conversations confidently in a challenging social setting
- Task 2: Lead or facilitate a group interaction, or help connect others
- Task 3: Complete a significant social challenge that demonstrates full integration of the skill (e.g., organize a meetup, give a toast, host something small, invite new connections to an activity)
- Focus: Demonstrating mastery, leadership, and full comfort with the goal

TASK WRITING GUIDELINES:
- Each task must be SPECIFIC with clear actions (not vague like "be confident")
- Include WHERE to go, WHAT to say/do, and HOW to prepare
- Make Task 1 of each day the easiest entry point for that day's theme
- Progressive difficulty: each task and each day should build on the previous
- Be realistic about time commitments and social energy required
- Account for introvert/extrovert needs and social anxiety
- Provide concrete conversation starters, examples, or scripts when relevant
