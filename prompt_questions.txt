"{goal_name}"

Please carefully analyze this goal and generate 4 to 6 relevant questions that will help you fully understand all important aspects needed to create a detailed, personalized plan.

Include questions that explore both:
- Specific details about this particular goal (e.g., motivation, obstacles, resources)
- General and common information important for any goal achievement (e.g., time availability, support system, habits)

Make the questions clear, natural, and easy to answer. Number them and return only the questions in a list without any additional text or commentary.
